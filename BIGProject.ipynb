      "<p>We believe that this absolutely is the killer, Acevedo said.</p>\n",
      "<p>Acevedo said the department received tips identifying Pappas as the gunman after authorities released new surveillance video Monday of the suspect riding his own bicycle through a neighborhood moments after the shooting.

      "<p>In 2000, Hausknecht treated Bush for an irregular heartbeat after the 41st president complained about lightheadedness. After Hausknecht's death, Bush called Hausknecht a fantastic cardiologist and a good man.</p>\n",
